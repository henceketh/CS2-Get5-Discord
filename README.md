## Usage

### 🔹 Start a New Match
Admins can start a match with the `/startgame` command:

```
/startgame players:10
```

This creates a **Lobby** voice channel and a **queue** text channel.

### 🔹 Link Your Steam Account
Users must link their Steam accounts before joining matches:

```
/send_linker
```

This prompts the user to enter their **SteamID**.

### 🔹 Join the Lobby
Simply join the **Lobby** voice channel to be added to the player queue.

### 🔹 Ready Check
Once enough players join, the bot starts a **ready check**. Players confirm their readiness by clicking a **Ready** button.

### 🔹 Draft Phase
Captains are assigned, and they **pick players** alternately.

### 🔹 Map Veto
Captains take turns **banning maps** until one remains.

### 🔹 Match Starts
The bot automatically starts the match on a dedicated **CS2 server** and provides players with a `connect` command.
